      <p class="feature">Herbst/Benson & Associates has provided geotechnical engineering,
        monitoring and testing services in the Maryland area since 1978. During
        this period, over 10,000 projects have been successfully completed.</p>
        <br/>
      <p>We perform geotechnical engineering studies for various types of residential,
        commercial, institutional, and retail development including buildings,
        pavements, bridges, and stormwater management wet and dry ponds, infiltration
        trenches, and basins. We have also developed a relationship with other
        qualified consultants, so that specialty services such as non-destructive
        foundation testing, vibration monitoring, rock mechanic consultation, and
        soil corrosion testing can be provided on a project if needed.
        <br/> <br/>
        Although Herbst/Benson & Associates is a small business, we can efficiently
        handle several projects simultaneously with a typical study duration of
        4 to 6 weeks. The professional staff includes a registered professional
        engineer with over 40 years experience, a staff geologist, and other
        individuals with degrees in related sciences. All of our full time
        technicians have at least 10 years experience in geotechnical monitoring
        and testing services. Standard soil laboratory testing and engineering
        analysis are handled in-house and drilling services are subcontracted to
        companies with whom we have had a working relationship for years.</p>
